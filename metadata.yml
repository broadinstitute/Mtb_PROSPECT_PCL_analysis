name: Reference-based chemical-genetic interaction profiling to elucidate small molecule
  mechanism of action in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
description: In an era of increasing resistance, new and effective strategies are
  needed for antibiotic discovery. Whole-cell active screens yield candidate compounds
  lacking mechanism-of-action (MOA) information, and thus do not provide biological
  insight for prioritization. We previously reported PROSPECT (**PR**imary screening
  **O**f **S**trains to **P**rioritize **E**xpanded **C**hemistry and **T**argets),
  an antimicrobial discovery strategy that measures chemical-genetic interactions
  between small molecules and a pool of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* mutants, each
  depleted of a different essential protein target. PROSPECT facilitates efficient
  hit prioritization by simultaneously identifying whole-cell active compounds with
  high sensitivity and providing early insights into their MOA. Here, we report a
  reference-based approach to infer MOA from often complex PROSPECT data. For this
  aim, we curated a reference set of 437 compounds with published, annotated MOA and
  known or suspected antitubercular activity, and applied PROSPECT to it. We then
  developed **P**erturbagen **CL**ass (PCL) analysis, a computational method that
  predicts MOA by comparing chemical-genetic interaction profiles of unknown compounds
  to those of this reference set. In leave-one-out cross-validation, PCL analysis
  correctly predicted MOA with 70% sensitivity and 75% precision. When applied to
  75 antitubercular leads with known MOA previously reported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
  PCL analysis similarly achieved 69% sensitivity and 87% precision. We also analyzed
  98 GSK compounds lacking MOA information, predicting 60 of them to act via a reference
  MOA, and followed up with functional validation of 29 compounds predicted to target
  respiration-related MOAs. Finally, we applied PROSPECT and PCL analysis to ~5,000
  compounds from larger unbiased libraries that had not been preselected for antitubercular
  activity. PCL analysis identified a novel scaffold lacking wild-type activity but
  predicted to inhibit respiration via QcrB, and we confirmed this prediction while
  chemically optimizing this scaffold to achieve wild-type activity. PCL analysis
  of PROSPECT data thus enables rapid MOA assignment and hit prioritization, advancing
  the discovery of new, potent antitubercular compounds.
