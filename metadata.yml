name: Reference-based chemical-genetic interaction profiling to elucidate small molecule
  mechanism of action in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
description: We previously reported an antibiotic discovery screening platform that
  identifies whole-cell active compounds with high sensitivity while simultaneously
  providing mechanistic insight, necessary for hit prioritization. Named PROSPECT,
  (PRimary screening Of Strains to Prioritize Expanded Chemistry and Targets), this
  platform measures chemical-genetic interactions between small molecules and pooled
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants, each depleted of a different essential protein.
  Here, we introduce Perturbagen CLass (PCL) analysis, a computational method that
  infers a compound's mechanism-of-action (MOA) by comparing its chemical-genetic
  interaction profile to those of a curated reference set of 437 known molecules.
  In leave-one-out cross-validation, we correctly predict MOA with 70% sensitivity
  and 75% precision, and achieve comparable results (69% sensitivity, 87% precision)
  with a test set of 75 antitubercular compounds with known MOA previously reported
  by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). From 98 additional GSK antitubercular compounds with unknown
  MOA, we predict 60 to act via a reference MOA and functionally validate 29 compounds
  predicted to target respiration. Finally, from a set of ~5,000 compounds from larger
  unbiased libraries, we identify a novel QcrB-targeting scaffold that initially lacked
  wild-type activity, experimentally confirming this prediction while chemically optimizing
  this scaffold. PCL analysis of PROSPECT data enables rapid MOA assignment and hit
  prioritization, streamlining antimicrobial discovery.
